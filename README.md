## Future Enhancements:
• Handle Sub-versions that are not numbers, such as the Latest or _test subversion folders which contain possible version that can be used. <br />
• Allow command prompt to remain open or paused after completion instead of closing, in case there are installation errors. <br />
• Capture any errors during installation, log them to a log file and indicate to user that installation was NOT succesful. <br />

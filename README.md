# Hack2022
## Hack-a-thon 2022 Project while working @ Escher Group - 2 days deadline

## You will need to get you Azure Access Key from this location, at the time of writing, the server is fileseverstdus:

## Future Enhancement:
• Handle Sub-versions that are not numbers, such as the Latest or _test subversion folders which contain possible version that can be used.
• Allow command prompt to remain open or paused after completion instead of closing, in case there are installation errors.
• Capture any errors during installation, log them to a log file and indicate to user that installation was NOT succesful.
